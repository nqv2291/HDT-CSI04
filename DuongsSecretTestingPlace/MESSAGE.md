## Creating a nice home

# Why do some people buy lots of things for their home?
I believe that when people buy furnitures and decorate their houses, it will make them become more cozy and comfortable.

# Do you think it is very expensive to make a home look nice?

Buying furnitures in a famous department stores is a great yet expensive way to decorate a house. However, I usually make things on my own as I believe that DIY objects are better decoratives for my cozy house.

# Why don't some people care about how their home looks?

I think because it's just an apartment, they can't spend much of their money on decorating the apartment if they don't plan to stay there long. One day they will move out and probably have to leave everything behind. Or maybe they are just too busy going out to work, they don't have that much time to stay in their cozy house so they decide not to decorate it.

## Different types of home

# In what ways is living in a flat/apartment better than living in a house?

I think there are additional services which make living in an apartment easier. For example, the apartment janitor or staff will take care of the garbage, the pool and literally everything in general.



# Do you think homes will look different in the future?

In the future, I think housing and many other types of structures will look very different from what they look like today.

Technological advances and innovative construction techniques mean that in construction engineers have achieved buildings in spaces where before it would never been believed possible to build something.

# Do you agree that the kinds of homes people prefer change as they get older?

I totally with the idea, an elederly person, for example, might prefer to live in a house with no stairs as they don't have to miserably climb up the stairs with a pain in their back.
