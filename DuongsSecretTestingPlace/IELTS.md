## Part 1
# Do you enjoy learning a foreign language

Absolutely, I honestly love to learn as many languages as I can. Well, a language of a country is often assosiated with its culture, so, learning languages means exploring new various cultures around the world. On top of that, the ability to speak a foreign language fluently can open the door to many job opportunities in international companies.

# Why do you think learning English is important

There are hundreds of different languages in the world, people with different mother tounge cannot communicate with each other. That is why English become the international language and it's really important. Because anyone from anywhere on Earth can talk with each other as long as they understands and speaks English fluently. Besides, as mentioned above, learning English helps me open the door to open positions in international enterprises.

# What kinds of languages did you learn at school

There are two languages that I learnt at school, one is my mother tounge, Vietnamese and the other is English. They are core subjects at school so I've been learning them since primary school. I've tried other languages such as French or Spanish but they were a bit more difficult to learn 

# Would it be easier to learn a foreign language at an early age

I think it depends on each person but there's one thing I know for sure. When a child is exposed to a new foreign language at an early age, he often has an affinity in that language. Apparently, having an interest in a language will actually help you master it pretty well. A friend of mine named Duong has been learning English since he was 5, he now has an incredible grade of the subject.

## Part 2
# Describe a product that you recently bought online
# what you bought
# when you purchased the product
# why you decided to buy it online
# explain whether you were satisfied with the product

Due the covid 19 epidemic, it has been pretty inconvenient for me to go shopping lately. So a month ago, I decided to buy stuffs online. The most recent thing I bought on the Internet is a pair of shoes. Honestly I have no intention of buying them online until I see its price. I was like 'Oh wow this pair of shoes is much cheaper than they are in traditional store'. But still, I really don't like shopping online, just when i have to, because i cannot touch, pick up or compare items like shoes and clothes when i'm browsing an online store. As a result, I had absolutely no idea about the quality and the comfort of the items until I receive them. However, this time I read some positive and negative customer feedbacks on the shoes, turns out people really like it and i decided to take a chance and order them online. The delivery took several weeks but I was quite satisfied with the design and quality of the shoes when they arrived, it pretty much looks the same as the browser images. I'm quite confident to use an online store again if i ever need anything.


## Part 3
# Why do many people shop online these days

Main idea 1: It’s become a much easier way to shop considering that it doesn’t even require you to leave your house
-When consumers are able to shop online, they don’t have to worry about store hours (The activity is literally a 24/7 affair)
-Social media and e-newsletters make it possible to target relevant communication to customers around the times when they’re most likely to buy – paydays, lunchtimes, after work, after the morning school run for example

Main idea 2: They can search for exactly what they want.
Supporting idea: 
-When shoppers go online to shop, it makes the entire browsing process a whole lot simpler.
-People look for what they want, find it and buy it."find"
-Online shopping makes searching for what you want so much easier.


# On what occations do people in your country buy things online

I think they often use online stores when they need to buy things from other countries. It is quite inconvenient and expensive to fly to a country just to buy a few items. And also I believe that people buy things online and they can have the items directly delivered to friends or relatives.

# Why do some people dislike buying things from online stores

In my opinions, there are two reasons for this. First of all, they don't want to wait for a long time just to get the item delivered. As a workaround, they can visit traditional sotres to check a wide variety of products before making a purchase. And secondly, they dont like online shopping because simply they cannot believe what they're seeing online is real. Sometimes those items don't meet our expectations once they arrive. In fact, this happens more frequently you might expect.

If my memory serves me right, I once come across Antony Star, a public figure in the US. Currently, Antony is one of the actors in The Boys, a TV show where bad villains are disguised as superheroes and it has become really famous recently. So Antony was born in Florida which is located in the United Staes. There are two children in his family, one of whom is now the producer of several TV shows that are broadcasted daily. Antony, who burn the midnight oil trying to improve his acting, is really thankful for the upbringing of his parents. During his school year, Antony exceled more than any other peers, and was appointed as the monitor of the class since he received good feedbacks from teacher. But without the assistance of his mentor, he wouldn't have such good techniques. In the show, he plays the role of Homelander, who is the strongest yet the most cruel hero. Homelander is also the antagonist of the show who many viewers really hate. But the more we hate Homelander, the more we love Antony with his amazing acting. If I have to describe him in a word, that would be 'ambitious achiever'. All in all, Antony is an inspiration for a lot of people including me and I hope to see more of his films in the cinematic industry.


# Which season do you like most in your country
Personally, my favorite season in my country is summer. Summer is the time when we students do not have to go to school so basically it's every student's favorite season. I also love to dress comfortably with tank tops in the summer, it helps my body move in a flexible way. Additionally, I really love eating ice cream in the summer, it's really tasteful and helps my body relieve the heat of the sun. Summer is also the time for swimming pools to open. I've learnt to swim since I was a kid and now it's one of my favorite activities to do.

# What do you normally do when it's sunny
I usually stay inside to avoid sunburnt because it's really harmful to my body. So I wait until the sunny weather is gone. Or maybe, I can go swimming in the local pool near my hometown, it's the best of the best things to do in summer. Another thing I could do is going to the mall because there are air conditioners there and look for stuffs that I can eat or wandering around the supermarket until it's dark outside.

# What kind of outdoor activities do you enjoy in winter
I love doing excercises in winter, partly since it's usually what people do to warm up there bodies to prevent themselves from freezing. I usually go jogging with my parents, sometimes my friends depending on whoever have free time. We always go jogging in the park near our hometown, I remember when I was a kid. I and my sister went there for a short walk when suddenly she chased after a dog and eventually tripped, I couldnt stop laughing but eventually I have to take her home and apply bandages on her wounds. Ah, what a memorable park.

# Do weather affect our lives
Sometimes, extreme weather can affect our lives in negative ways. For instance, our country is normally affected by strong winds and heavy rains from tropical storms during the middle of the year. They caused serious damage to roads, houses and buildings. Especially the Central part of vietnam, which is located next to the East Sea, this region always experience hurricane and thunderstorms which cause a lot of difficulties for its residents. At the same time, though, we need the rain for agriculture, plants cannot grow without rain so it does have some benefits.

## Describe a time when your life was affected by the weather
If my memories served me right, I remember one time when I struggled with the weather. It was last year when I was still in my first term of school. I was on my way to school even though I'm late when suddenly down poured the rain. Somehow I forgot to bring an umbrella so I rushed to the nearest shelter and wait until the rain is gone. But turns out it was actually a very huge storm. The sky was black, the coulds are sparking with lightning and it was raining cats and dogs. I was so afraid of being late at the time but luckily, a man living there saw me, he went into his garrage and took his car, park right in front of me. He offered me a drive, I felt so grateful that I almost burst into tears. Although I arrived school late, the teacher did not ground me for it after I told her what I had gone through. Later that day, I bought some gifts to thank the man who helped me. I felt really lucky to have such amazing people in my neighborhood

# Do you think it is important to find a job related to your major
Absolutely, I think it's very necessary to get a job related to my major, because I want to take advantage of my knowledge and expertise I've picked up through my major. I want to apply all the things that I've learnt in my university in an actual, professional environment. Without those knowledge, I think it would probably bring a lot of difficulties especially when I want get a higher position of a company. In other words, my major definitely decides my job.

# Hard job with high salary or easy job with low salary
I think my answer will change as I age. Right now, I'm very young and I don't mind if I choose a hard job with higher salary because I need money to live a prosperous and comfortable life. And also, I'm a naturally hard worker, I would love to face a lot of obstacles and challenges in my career. But when I get old, I really want an easy job, because then I will have a lot of physical incapabilites which will prevent me from being productive in a professional environment. Plus, I believe by the time that i'm old, I will have a lot of savings. Therefore, I wont need to take a hard job with high salary just for the sake of money anymore. Maybe I just want to do it for fun so I can still find the meaning of life.

# What difficulties are there when finding a job in your country
Well, simply because there are too many candidates yet too few positions in companies due to the economic recession. Almost everyone nowadays owns a degree or a related degree. Therefore, it is very difficult to select employee since qualifications are not held in such high regard anymore. Another thing is that, employee needs to be fluent in English to have a slight chance of promotion in an international company. It's the 21th century now, everyone needs to have some sort of certifications such as IELTS or TOEFL to prove their English fluency to the interviewer. Which again accounts for a big amount of time and money to get one.
